# COMP421P3 - The JDBC Program of KABY ðŸšš

KABY is a fictional logistics company that provides global C2C delivery services. The company's structure is modelled on a generalised representation of delivery companies like DHL, UPS, etc. The name KABY is based on the first letter of each group member's name.

In the course COMP-421: Database Systems, Our group developed KABY over three projects. In this third and final project, one of the objectives was to produce a JDBC program that allows users to query KABY's SQL database. The available query options are:
1. Finding the delivery date of an order
2. Estimating the delivery time of an order
3. Adding a new order to the database
4. Updating the price of the goods stored in an order
5. Reassigning an employee to an order
